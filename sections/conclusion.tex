As seen in the reflections, there have been some ideas in the project, that didn't have as big an effect as expected, when it was confronted with the market. Therefore it can be concluded, that it was a good idea to do research before making the final product definition.   


Through the market analysis, it has been discovered that the customers isnâ€™t the source to the biggest income, but that it is the shops, with a business subscription, which is the best opportunity for earning money. 


As seen in the reflections, the fishing map got good response because it could replace the worn out signs, near the fishing places. A good partner for the fishing map, is the government, because the app could make it cheaper for them, instead of costly maintenance of the signs. 


Overall, the fishing guide/map and the sell function for the shops, will be the best to continue working with and develop. The renting segment shoved that is was more a secondary function, than a primary function, therefore the focus was to minimise it.
