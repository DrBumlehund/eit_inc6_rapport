The product is a multi functional application, where the main focus is to get knowledge about fishing and acquiring access to fishing areas in foreign places. 
The users of this application is divided into two groups: customers and shops. 

\subsection{The Customers}
The application provides knowledge for the customers by providing a platform, where it is possible to see a map with fishings areas, near the customer.

It provides a way to rent equipment, in case the customer does not have any or didnâ€™t bring their equipment. 

The platform makes it easy to update or buy a fishing card and harder to forget, by saving it in the application. If the customer is a first time fisher or simply out of shape, there is a guide in the application, with tips and tricks, e.g.; How to tie a knot for the hook or information about which kind of fish is in season for catching. 

In case the customer has equipment, which he/she no longer uses, the platform provides a place for renting out the equipment.
