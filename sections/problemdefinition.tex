%Problem Definition
The Problem was raised by team member Britt M. Wamberg, who had experienced, as a freediver, travelling to foreign destinations, but staying out of the water, due to the lack of knowledge about the local water conditions, such as the current and tides.

The following problem definition was produced, based on her problem: 

\begin{center}
\textit{“How to obtain local knowledge, in a foreign location?”}
\end{center}

The team worked on the idea of creating a software platform, for foreign people to connect with local people, to get answers to their questions. The users of the platform should be able to arrange a meetup with a local, to learn a skill, exchange equipment, or get shown around a desired area.
